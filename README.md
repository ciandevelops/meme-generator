# Scrimba

This project is created as part of a React Tutorial on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).

The project uses API calls for the first time. 

I am following the design from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MoLwFPHNHJVrzdFurxHzNV/Meme-Generator?node-id=2%3A2) to style my project.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
